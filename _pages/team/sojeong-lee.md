Sojeong completed her undergraduate studies in systems biology
and bioinformatics, where she conducted research on microRNA and
chromatin regulation related to fly growth hormone signaling as an
undergraduate. This exploration continued during her internship at the
Chang lab, where she discovered a passion and aptitude for biochemical
technique development, mainly through optimizing *in vitro* experiments.
As she starts her graduate studies at Seoul National University in 2024,
Sojeong is poised to further her research. Her primary focus will be the
high-throughput technologies aimed at elucidating the complex regulatory
mechanisms governed by RNA-binding proteins.
