Junsoo Kim is a computational biologist driven by a deep curiosity to unravel the complex world of RNA biology. His research centers on investigating the intricate interplay between post-transcriptional modifications and the fate of RNA molecules, with a particular focus on understanding how these modifications regulate RNA stability and translation efficiency.

Junsoo's journey in bioinformatics began with a master's degree from the University of Oxford, followed by a stint at the Genomic Medicine Institute at Seoul National University (GMI-SNU) as a substitute for national service. There, he worked on [de novo assembly of the Korean reference genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20098), which sparked his fascination with the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation.

After gaining valuable experience as a senior researcher at biotech companies like Seegene and Macrogen, Junsoo joined Chang Lab in 2021 to pursue his Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Seoul National University. In the lab, he led a study that uncovered the molecular mechanisms by which [SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts host translation in the lungs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-023-01110-0), providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. 

Building upon this foundation, Junsoo now aims to leverage the power of high-throughput sequencing technologies and deep learning to develop innovative computational methods that can detect and quantify RNA modifications with unprecedented resolution. Through his research, Junsoo hopes to shed light on the dynamic landscape of the RNA lifecycle and contribute to a deeper understanding of how post-transcriptional regulation shapes gene expression in health and disease.
