Sohyeon Ju holds a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences with a
minor in Forestry. During her undergraduate studies, she developed
a deep appreciation for the diversity and complexity of life seen
through a scientific lens. Since 2022, she has been drawn to the
power of computational and quantitative approaches in extracting
insights from high-throughput data to uncover the underlying logic
of intricate biological systems. Her current research focuses on
(1) studying the role of TENT4A/B deadenylase in neuronal contexts
using ONT direct-RNA sequencing and (2) optimizing coding sequences
in therapeutic mRNA to enhance efficacy through *in silico*
optimization and experimental validation.
