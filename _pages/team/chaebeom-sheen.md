Chaebeom joined as a visiting member while on leave
from medical school. He is participating on developing
[VaxPress](https://github.com/ChangLabSNU/VaxPress), an advanced genetic
algorithm approach for codon optimization for mRNA vaccines. Chaebeom
focused on <i>N</i><sup>1</sup>-methylpseudouridine, a modified nucleotide
used in mRNA vaccines. He also implemented VaxPress on a cloud platform
using Kubernetes for scalable, distributed optimization. This experience
has provided him with a unique blend of skills at the intersection of
biological science and technology. Chaebeom gained hands-on expertise
in cloud computing, distributed systems, Python, and machine learning,
deepening his interdisciplinary knowledge. He aims to explore further
applications of computational approaches in medicine and human biology,
with a particular interest in bridging clinical practice and computational
biology, potentially in areas like personalized medicine or computational
pathology.
