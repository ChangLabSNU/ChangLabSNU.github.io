Yoojung Han studied broadly about biochemistry, materials engineering, 
and molecular biology during her B.S. at Seoul National University.
Then, she found her interests in computational biology and bioinformatics, 
and jumped up to the new study field since 2020 summer as a member of Chang lab.

Her research focuses on developing innovative methods to explore the relationships between DNA and RNA processing or regulation. To conduct this research, she primarily uses nanopore sequencing, which enables simultaneous analysis of diverse DNA and RNA characteristics. She is continually expanding her skill set to encompass all aspects necessary for this work, from wet lab experiments in molecular biology to data analysis and software development.
