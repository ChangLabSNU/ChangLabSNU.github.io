Heeseung Yoo was a graduate student under M.S. program in Bioinformatics
at Seoul National University. She studied Computer Engineering and
Data Analytics during her B.S. at Sookmyung Women’s University. She
also studied Biological Science as a double major, which became an
opportunity to get interested in bioinformatics. In 2022, she joined
Dr. Hyeshik Chang's lab to expand her work into an in-depth study of
bioinformatics. She did excellent works in algorithm development and
software implementation to reveal internal information in nanopore
sequencing data and detecting RNA modification.
