Yongkuk and Hyeshik had a fruitful collaboration from 2016 to 2019
while working together in Narry Kim's lab. During this time, Yongkuk
made significant contributions by developing a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/hyeshik/poreplex/">poreplex</a>
for measuring poly(A) tail length and demultiplexing barcoded libraries
using nanopore direct RNA sequencing. Following this productive period,
Yongkuk decided to expand his expertise beyond molecular biology and
transitioned to the field of medicine. After completing his military
duty, he briefly returned to the lab to assist in the development of new
technologies for time-series transcriptome analysis using nanopore
sequencing. Now back in medical school, he is eagerly exploring the
non-molecular aspects of human biology.
